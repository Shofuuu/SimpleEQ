# SimpleEQ - A Simple Equalizer Application using JUCE Library

## Introduction

SimpleEQ is a simple equalizer application that uses the JUCE library to demonstrate how to build a basic audio application. The JUCE library is a cross-platform C++ library that provides a set of tools for building complex audio applications.

## Prerequisites

To build and run this application, you will need the following:

- A compiler that supports C++11 or later
- The JUCE library
- A development environment that supports JUCE (such as Visual Studio, Xcode, or Projucer)

## Building the Application

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/SimpleEQ.git


2. Open the project in your development environment.

3. Build and run the application.

## Using the Application

The SimpleEQ application has a simple user interface that allows you to adjust the level of various frequency bands in an audio signal. To use the application, simply adjust the sliders to change the levels of the different frequency bands.

## Conclusion

This simple equalizer application is just the beginning of what you can do with the JUCE library. With its powerful tools and flexible architecture, you can build a wide range of audio applications, from simple utilities to complex audio processing systems.
